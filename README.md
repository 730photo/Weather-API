#WEATHER

<h3>
This took me a litt longer than I hoped because I had to start over a few times, + I spent countless hours debugging errors but I finally finished👨🏾‍💻.
<br>
I built my own weather app using an external api from apixu.com <br>
With this app you can check the current weather and also the weather for the next 4 days of any city you would like to.<br>
